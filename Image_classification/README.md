# Image Classification Projects

This folder includes deep learning projects focused on image classification, specifically for detecting pollen on bees and identifying brain tumors. Each project is implemented using Jupyter notebooks and is designed to be run on Google Colab.

## Project Details

### Bee with Pollen Detection
This project aims to detect the presence of pollen on bees, using different model architectures.

- `pollen_my_model.ipynb`: Custom model developed for pollen detection on bees.
- `pollen_with_MobileNet.ipynb`: Implementation of pollen detection using the MobileNet architecture.
- `pollen_with_VGG19.ipynb`: Model for pollen detection based on the VGG19 architecture.

### Brain Tumor Detection
This project focuses on detecting brain tumors in medical images, using custom and pretrained models.

- `brain_tumor_with_VGG19.ipynb`: Brain tumor detection model utilizing VGG19.
- `brain_tumor_my_model.ipynb`: Custom model for detecting brain tumors.
