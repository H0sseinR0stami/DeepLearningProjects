# Text Generation Projects

This folder includes projects focused on generating text using different recurrent neural network (RNN) architectures, including standard RNNs and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. These projects were implemented in Jupyter notebooks and are intended for use on Google Colab.

## Project Details

- `Text_Generation_using_LSTMs.ipynb`: Text generation model using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, designed to generate coherent sequences based on training data.
- `text_generation_with_RNN.ipynb`: Text generation model based on a standard Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) architecture.
