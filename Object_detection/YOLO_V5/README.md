# Object Detection using YOLO_V5

This project focuses on object detection using the YOLO_V5 model, specifically trained to detect balls and people. The project was developed using Jupyter notebooks on Google Colab.

## Project Details

- `TRAIN_YOLO_V5_ON_YOUR_CUSTOM_DATASET.ipynb`: Notebook for training the YOLO_V5 model on a custom dataset. The model is configured to detect balls and people, useful in applications such as sports analysis and security.

## Dataset and Annotations
For this project, I created and labeled my own dataset, which includes images of balls and people. Both the dataset and code are available at the following link:
